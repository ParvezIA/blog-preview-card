### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Building this project from scrach was a big task for me. I learned How i can use the flexbox and impliment it in the project. learing from coursed like [FreecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/Parvez_410) Have given me so much that this project feels little easy 

### Continued development

The live preview of the project seems very nice but there are still few things I'm not satisfied with the code that  could be improved and make it clean.
